Release Note

Renesas
RX200 Series
IEC60730 Self Test code for use in Eclipse + GNU Environment.

28th May 2012
Version 1.0

This is a port of the IEC60730 Self Test code to E2Studio(Eclipse) + GNU Rx environment from the original HEW + Renesas toolchain environment.

Contents of Delivery
1. This Release Note.txt
2. Application Note
3. E2Studio_Project folder. This contains an archive (zip) of an E2Studio project which contains the test files.
E2Studio can import this archive directly: File->Import->Existing project into Workspace->Archive "RX210_Selftests.zip". 


Environment:
Renesas E2Studio Version 1.0.0.38
GNU Rx Version 12.01
Big Endian

The project consists of two parts:
1. The test files: /src/tests
2. Example usage of test files: E2Studio project.

Differences from HEW + Renesas project:
1. Test Files

1.a.
The Renesas toolchain provided a mechanism for automatically adding an interrupt handler to the vector table, GCC does not.
Hence, in the following files an interrupt handler has been replaced with a function that a user must ensure is called from the
corresponding interrupt handler:
POE.c : Interrupt_POE2_OEI1.
Clock_monitor.c: Interrupt_CAC_FERRF and Interrupt_CAC_OVFF

1.b.
C files that contain assembly had to be altered because of the different ways the compilers facilitate the inclusion of assembly within a C file.
However, the underlying functionality of the tests have not been changed.


2. Example usage

2.a. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
The Renesas toolchain provided a mechanism for automatically adding a reference CRC to the mot file.
This facility is not available in GCC.
Consequentially the part of the sample code that checks the calculated CRC against a reference
CRC has been removed. A user must use their own method for adding a reference CRC.

2.b. Section Addresses
The Renesas toolchain provides section address operators 'sectop' and 'secend'.
These were used to calculate the address ranges for RAM and ROM tests.
In some cases these have been replaced with #defines of a hard coded address, taken from the linker map, but there is also an example
of how GCC allows section labels to be accessed. See the initialisation of the CRC_ranges structure in file RX210_SelfTests.c.


Application Note:
The Application Note has been written for the HEW and Renesas toolchain.
Therefore, please be aware of the differences specified in this release note when reading the Application Note.
The Benchmarking section of the Application Note contains data produced using the Renesas toolchain.
Benchmarking has not been done using GCC.

E2Studio Debugging:
If using an E1 debugger ensure the E1 is configured correctly:
See Run->Debug Configurations->Renesas GDB Hardware->RX210_SelfTests HardwareDebug->Debugger->Debug Tool Settings
Ensure the Target Device is correct for the RX200 device you are debugging and that Big Endian Mode is set.

Issues
1. If using the auto generated file vectors_table.c.
The vector for POE2_OEI1 is missing from the file.
Please add the following:
//;0x02A8  POE2_OEI1
(fp)INT_Excep_POE2_OEI1,

2. The auto generated iodefine.h file has an error in the little endian configuration.
Therefore, currently this software must only be used in big endian mode.
This issue will be fixed in a later release of GNU Rx.
