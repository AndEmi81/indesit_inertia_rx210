@{
\n			The OCADC driver offers a standardized access to the on chip Analog to Digital Converter.
\n\li		The Analog to Digital Converter will be set up to the native resolution meet best the required resolution.
\n\li		The convertion will be always right justified.
\n\li 		If in AdcConfig.h is defined ADC_USE_HW_DMA to 1, the ADC will allow the use of hardware DMA for convertions,
\n\li		is responsability of HAL reporting an error if HW DMA is not supported by M.C.U..
\n\li 		If in AdcConfig.h is defined ADC_USE_SW_DMA, the ADC will allow the use of sofware DMA for convertions,
\n\li		is responsability of HAL reporting an error if SW DMA is not supported by M.C.U.
\n\li		It is nessary to set up the DMA channel number for the transmission in AdcConfig.h
\n
\n          The drivers offers 4 types of possible sample conversion:
\n\li       StartSampleSync - start sample and then wait for the result. When the sample is converted the callback function
            can be called or the user can use the function IsConvertionReadySync.
\n\li       SampleSync - the sample is started and the function waits for the result. Not recommended for critical real time applications.
\n\li       StartMultiSampleOneChannelSync - this function starts conversion of the desired number of samples on the same channel.
            This function requires SW or HW DMA driver to be included where 1 DMA channel is required. At the end of the conversion
            a user callback is called. The samples are copied into the user buffer.
\n\li       StartMultiSampleMultiChannelSync - this function starts conversion of the desired number of samples on the channels defined
            by the user buffer. This function requires SW or HW DMA driver to be included where 2 DMA channels are required. At the end
            of the conversion a user callback is called. The samples are copied into the user buffer.
