/**
\defgroup	OCLVD OCLVD (Low Voltage Detect)
@{
\n      The driver sets the LVD module to generate the
\n      reset if the voltage is low and to generate warning.
\n
\par    Configuration:
\n
\n      The user should set up the \b UC_VDD_X_10 constant in BoardConfigurations.h.
\n      To set up the module the OCLVDR_SetSync function is to be called
\n      and sets the detection trip. Then the OCLVDW_SetSync function is
\n      to be called to set up the warning flag and interrupt routine.
