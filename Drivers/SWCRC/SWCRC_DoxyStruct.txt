\defgroup	SWCRC SWCRC (Software CRC)
@{
\n			The SWCRC driver is able to compute CRC CCITT checksum on a buffer.
\n          It is useful for all microcontrollers that don't have hardware CRC computation and
\n          is the counterpart of OCCRC driver.
\par        Configuration:
\n          You have to provide a file CRC_cfg.h included in Config.h, if you don't define
\n          \b CRC_HW automatically will be choosed Software CRC computation,
\n          At this point you may define \b CRC_SW_TABLE_DRIVEN
\n          if you want table driven computation otherwise you will have loop driven computation.
\n          Table driven computation is faster than Loop driven computation but requires more flash.
\n          (about 500 bytes more).
\par        Exported Functions:
\n\li       SWCRC_InitSync()
\n\li       SWCRC_DeInitSync()
\n\li       SWCRC_Calculate()
