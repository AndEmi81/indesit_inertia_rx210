/**
\defgroup	OCFLS OCFLS (Flash)
@{
\n			The FLS driver offers a standardized access to the FLASH memory.
\n
\par Configuration:
\n  		A table with flash's sections avaible for erase/write operations must be provided in Config.c.
\n			Eg.
\n\b 		BEGIN_MCU_FLASH_MAP(NUM_FLASH_BLOCKS)
\n				0x1080,0x17FF,
\n				0x182C,0xFFFF
\n\b		END_MCU_FLASH_MAP()
\n			where NUM_FLASH_BLOCKS must be defined in FlashConfig.h included in Config.h.
\n			Eg.
\n			##define <b> NUM_FLASH_BLOCKS 2 </b>
\n  		A table with flash's sections avaible for erase/write operations or only for write
\n          operations must be provided in Config.c.
\n			Eg.
\n\b 		BEGIN_MCU_FLASH_MAP_ERASE(NUM_FLASH_BLOCKS)
\n          1,  Only Write Operations on block 0x1080,0x17FF
\n          0   Erase/Write Operations on block 0x182C,0xFFFF
\n\b		END_MCU_FLASH_MAP_ERASE()
