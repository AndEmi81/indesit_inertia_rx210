/**
\defgroup	OCCRC OCCRC (Hardware CRC)
@{
\n			The OCCRC driver is able to compute CRC CCITT checksum on a buffer.
\n          It is used for all microcontrollers that have hardware CRC module and
\n          is the counterpart of SWCRC driver.
\n
\version 01.00
\n
\par        Configuration:
\n
\n          You have to configure CONFIG_PL_DRV_OCCRC - through configurator option is PL_DRV_OCCRC.
\n          Target HAL must provide CRC_HW_SUPPORTED directive, otherwise it will raise an error.
\n
\par Exported Functions (Platform Level):
\li       OCCRC_InitSync()
\li       OCCRC_DeInitSync()
\li       OCCRC_Calculate()



\n
\n
\par Architecture Requirements ID:
\li	SARS_WMMT_MN_DrvCRC_1
\li SARS_WMMT_MN_DrvCRC_2
