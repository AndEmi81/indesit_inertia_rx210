config CSN_DISABLE_MODULE
  bool "Disable module"
  default n
  help
    Disable Coductivity Sensor module. 
    All functions and variables are still present, but nothing 
    will happen when functions are called - no initialization and no updates.
    
    It's useful if you want save flash without excluding from build. 

config CSN_PWD_FILTER_ENABLE
	bool "Enable PWD filter support"
	default n
	help
		Enable PWD Timer filter
		This option allows to define a minimum time of each edge (rising/falling) to filter
		noise.

config CSN_PWD_FILTER_TIME
depends on CSN_PWD_FILTER_ENABLE
	int "PWD filter time (in ns)"
	range 1 50000000
	default 1000000
	help
		Set PWD filter time
		This is minimum time (in ns) accepted for edge validation.

config CSN_EDGE_RISING
	bool "Rising"
	help
	  	the signal's period is measured starting from rising edge

config CSN_EDGE_FALLING
	bool "Falling"
	help
	  	the signal's period is measured starting from falling edge

config CSN_USE_DIGITAL_FILTER
    bool "Enable Digital pin filter (if available in micro used) on tacho"
    default n
    help
        Enable Digital Pin filter
        This option allows to define maximum acceptance frequency for Tacho
        input; real filter applied depends on features availalbe on 
        micro used for this application. 

config CSN_DIGITAL_FILTER_FREQ
    depends on CSN_USE_DIGITAL_FILTER
    int "Digital filter frequency (in kHz)"
    range 1 50000
    default 2000
    help
        Set Digital filter time
        This is maximum frequency (in kHz) accepted for edge validation.            

config CSN_DISABLE_TON_READING
    bool "Disable T.On Reading"
    default y
    help
        Disable T.On Reading
        This option forces reading of Period only, reducing too high interrupt
        occurrencies while keeping same information. If this option is disabled
        there are more interrupts but signal is better validated (check on
        both edges and I/O validation on the signal)

config CSN_CHECK_IOSENSE
    bool "Edge detection configured depending on Inverted logic flag"
    default y
    help 
        Edge detection configured depending on Inverted logic flag
        Enabling this option, edge detection will be set regardless of
        Invert logic flag set in setting file: this ensures to detect the most
        robust edge found (e.g. rising edge)  

choice

config CSN_CONTINUOUS_ENABLE_FREQ
	int "Enabling Continuous mode Frequency"
