\defgroup   PM_PowerProfile
@{ 
\n Appliance Power Profile (APP) is the power profile associated to each cycle / 
   configuration of the machine.
   The APP is divided into energy phases; each energy phase is defined by means of
   five parameters:
   \li Power Phase ID
   \li Expected Duration
   \li Peak Power
   \li Energy
   \li Maximum Activation Delay

   The Energy Phases are not coincident with the appliance functional phases but are 
   correlated with them, because all the energy phase parameters depend on the functional 
   activities (in particular electrical loads activation) the machine performs at
   each moment.
   The APP shall be estimated and available (for communication with a central unit or a 
   user interface) when the user selects a particular cycle and options/regulations set 
   and could be updated when it is necessary.
   It is possible to communicate that a energy phase has STARTED or ENDED.
   The APP is used by the central controller as an input for dynamic power managing purpose 
   and scheduling activities.

\par     The aim
   The aim is:
   \li Characterization of the nominal values for the parameters of the energy phases;
   \li Mechanisms to correct these ratings in relation to:
   - Options and regulations set by the user (before cycle start and during the cycle execution);
   - Special events that may occur during the execution of the cycle (eg. The estimated 
   load in the washing machine);

   This module implements the power profile computation exploiting both 
   Power Profile Data and Energy Phase Data pointers.

\par     Architecture
\n       This module is organized in three parts:
\li     monitoring application variables (cycle, phase and  regulations)
\li     computation of the power profile fired  by any changes in one of the previous variables
        and of the regulation with modifiers.
\li     general functions

\par Configuration:
\li	APP_COMPARTMENTS	(mandatory)
\li	APP_ENERGY_PHASES_MAX_NUM
\li APP_REGULATIONS		(mandatory)
\li APP_STATIC_COMPARTMENTS

 This property is optional, if defined, it allows the module for communication
   about internal errors which may occur.
   For the list of errors see \ref LinkedLoadsError_Type 
   Example:
   in the file \e PowerProfileConfig.h

#define DEBUG_POWERPROFILE
