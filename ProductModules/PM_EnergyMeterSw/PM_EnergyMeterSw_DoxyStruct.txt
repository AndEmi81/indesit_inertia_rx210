 \Par  Energy Meter
 \n    This module implements the interface APIs to the Energy Meter.
 \n    Available operations on this device are mainly Reset, Configure (default configuration
 \n    not changeable), Start and Stop measure.
 \n    Then you can read energy parameters like Power, V, Vrms, Energy (Since start).
 \n
 \n    There are also APIs that allows to start and stop Energy consumption counters:
 \n    With start you must provide also a time period and an energy thresholds.
 \n    On these counters you can retrieve the value (energy in Wh consumed since start), the
 \n    time elapsed (s since start) and the MAX energy consumed in a 10 seconds time slice.
 \n    Moreover you have back some flags that tells if the energy counter reached the given
 \n    threshold in the given time period.
 \n    Other flags are the running state of the counter (started/stopped) and the running state
 \n    of the timer (Time period elapsed or not).
